# Death Map NYC
This is the source code for [deathmapnyc.com](http://deathmapnyc.com).


### Limitations
- Some records contain multiple deaths, especially the OSHA and motor vehicle records. These still appear as one icon on the map.
- The data is messy, some deaths aren't displayed because there wasn't enough information
- The location data is particularly messy, and is often the result of geocoding an address, which may or may not be accurate, and for OSHA data may in some cases be the address of the employer rather than the location of the accident


### 2015 Version
This is my second attempt at this, the first version from 2015 is [here](http://zischwartz.github.io/deathmapnyc_old/dist/)[(source code)](https://github.com/zischwartz/deathmapnyc_old) but it may break your browser.
